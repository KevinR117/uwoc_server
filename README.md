# Server UWOC

## Usage

This server application is supposed to be running on the RedPitaya Card.

It contains a server that is waiting for distant machines (clients) to send data
(like video data for example).

It also waits for data from the input analog port of the RedPitaya Card so it
can send it back to the clients that are connected to the server.
